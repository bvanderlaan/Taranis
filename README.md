# Taranis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bvanderlaan/Taranis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bvanderlaan/Taranis)

Taranis is a tool which can be used in Qt projects to provide a command line interface for inputting start up parameters into your application.

GUI applications or background processes tend to have flags now and again to allow users to alter how the applicaiton will run. They might have 
flags to change their logging level or alter server connection addresses. The code to process the command line arguments fed into an application
is largely boiler plate but to do it nicely is a bit of a pain.

Taranis is a class you can instanciate which will handle parsing whatever type of command line argument your applicaiton requires. It will deal with
case sensativity and differances in flag syntax such as backslashes (/), dashes (-), or double dashes (--) as well as differances in convension such as
triggering help with either an 'h' or a question mark (?). Taranis will also provide long and short forms of your desired flags such as '--help' or '-h'.

Taranis will also take care of generating help text and printing it to the console when the help flag is provided.
